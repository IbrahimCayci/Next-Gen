# Spring Boot and React Application

## Overview
This project is a full-stack web application that combines a Spring Boot backend with a React frontend. The application is designed to provide [briefly describe what the application does, e.g., "a platform for managing user profiles and image uploads."].

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:
- Java 17 or later
- Node.js 18.x or later
- Maven 3.8.x or later (optional if using Maven wrapper)
- npm 9.x or later

## Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name/backend
    ```

2. **Configure the application:**
    - Update `application.properties` or `application.yml` with your database and other configuration details.
    
3. **Build the application:**
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    ```
    *(Alternatively, you can use `mvn` if you have Maven installed globally.)*

4. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
    The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Frontend Setup (React)

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running the Full Application

To run the full application, make sure both the backend and frontend are running simultaneously. You can access the React frontend at `http://localhost:3000`, which will interact with the Spring Boot backend at `http://localhost:8080`.
